# dataline
Hello and Welcome!
Myself Ritwik. I am a VFX lighting artist, for films. Here I am sharing one of my latest project/tool that is "Dataline"- a film/episodic/freelance project pipeline core folder generator, based on Python 3.7.7 and tkinter GUI and other python librerries like pillow(PIL).

Purpose: by using Dataline:-
	1) anyone can Generate Show(project) > asset > Sequence > Shot - based Complete folder structure from rnd/start to project delivery/finish with ease
	2) It helps to maintain a proper workflow across artists, technical directors, developers, producers, directors, clients at one place.

*) Here I have attached the 'dataline.exe' (the application/tool) , folder 'sourceImages' (where all the used images/logo/icon lives). and this readme.txt file

*) you just need to unzip/extract the datalineExecutable.zip file (i hope you must have done it by now). and make sure the 'dataline.exe' & the 'sourceImages'-folder is at the same place and not inside any tree folders. what i mean is both of the contents of the .zip file should be at the same place. 

Example :: the path of the dataline.exe should be like: 
(***)If you wanna keep and use this tool from desktop then keep them like this-
						"C:\Users\Thinkstation\Desktop\dataline.exe" & "C:\Users\Thinkstation\Desktop\sourceImages"

(***)If you wanna keep and use this tool from a folder/drive then keep them like this-
						"X:PIPELINE\Dataline\datalineExecutable\dataline.exe" & "X:PIPELINE\Dataline\datalineExecutable\sourceImages"
